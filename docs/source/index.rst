ManufacturingNet provides a sustainable, open-source ecosystem of modern artificial intelligence (AI) tools for tackling
diverse engineering challenges.

Written in Python3 and designed for ease of use, ManufacturingNet's machine learning library simplifies AI for
manufacturing professionals.

ManufacturingNet is developed and maintained by the Mechanical and AI Lab (MAIL) at Carnegie
Mellon University.
